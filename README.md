# Warcraft_Hub

Timers, API's, and all the other interesting tidbits one might need for planning World of Warcraft.

## Notes

Going to be doing something like this, but for WoW -

[WarframeHub](https://hub.warframestat.us/#/)

[Github Link](https://github.com/WFCD/warframe-hub)

The end goal will be to have all the general information - world boss spawns, world quest rewards, auction house pricing, news and updates from wowhead, rare spawn timers, etc.

Secondary it will include a notes section, for things like a certain key you want to run, or simple notes that you want to carry over between sessions.

Stretch goal will be character-API integration, raiderio integration, logins, and the ability to modify the home screen to add/remove/move modules to get a more customized layout.

Dark/Light theme will be a mandatory requirement, color and module palette will be material-ui, base will be built on React.

Super simple, super effective.
